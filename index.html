<p>I am a simple human being. Not much different than you.
  I am on a quest to live this life to the fullest. In any way-spiritual, financial, inspirational...when I say anything, I mean it.
  I am a traveller, try-hard poet, a song-writer, a diary-lover, a dog and <b>life obsessed maniac</b>. YouÂ´re welcome to join this journey of mine.
